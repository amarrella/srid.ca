# Naiveté

> **Naiveté** is so vital to freedom. This is because even the strictest application of moralistic and ethicalistic injunctions will never lead to the clean clarity of the purity of living the perfection of the infinitude of this material universe. Purity is an actual condition – intrinsic to this universe – that a human being can tap into by pure intent. Pure intent can be activated with earnest ([[[8184b1bc]]]) attention paid to the state of naiveté. To be naïve is to be 
> - virginal, 
> - unaffected,
> - unselfconsciously artless ... in short: 
> - ingenuous. 
>
> Naiveté is a much-maligned word, having the common assumption that it implies gullibility. Nevertheless, to be naïve means to be
> - simple and
> - unsophisticated.

## Naiveté as an aid to deprogram oneself 

> RESPONDENT The world has tremendous subtle violence going on then doesn’t it? (I hope I do not sound too naive).

> RICHARD: No, you are most definitely not ‘too naive’. It is the cultured sophisticates that cause – and have caused – such untold damage on this fair earth. **Naiveté is a beneficence ... it is what I got in touch with to enable me to steer my way through the maze of conditioning ... a conditioning that stretches back into antiquity**. Naiveté is the closest thing one has got to an actual innocence ... one can rely much more upon it to see one’s way clearly than one can rely upon the most profound thought or the most sublime feeling. No matter how lofty the thought or deep the feeling, unless one is nearly innocent, one will never succeed.
