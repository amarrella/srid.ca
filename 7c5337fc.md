# Actualism Method

The **actualism method** aims to mimic the perfection experienced in a <5da5c417>[^pcealt] by dedicating[^dedicate] to being in a good mood[^whymood] each and every moment[^choice] (via <3ef2e75e>), until the moment dawns wherein that perfection becomes the de facto mode of experiencing (i.e., one becomes actually free[^lifestyle]).

See also: <a1db1d8b> and <0931acd9>.

This part of the site represents the ongoing distillation of my understanding of how all of this works as I continue to succeed at practicing actualism[^notes].

[^pcealt]: If one cannot recall or has had a Pure Consciousness Experiece, they can instead opt for <5576a5d9?cf>.

[^dedicate]: <9a01a8cf>

[^whymood]: Why? Because it is much easier to *stay* in a good mood (preferably a happy mood, of course) than *claw one's way back* up to feeling good, again and again, after having habitually reverted to one's type.

[^choice]: 
    Here's how that part of the method is officially described:
    > RICHARD: It is important to comprehend that the aim, the goal, of actualism practice is the enjoyment and appreciation of being alive **right now** â€“ at this very moment of being alive and not indefinitely postponed off into some indeterminate **future**. --[This Moment Of Being Alive](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm)
    
    And, it is possible to feel good each and every moment because <974ce006?cf>.

[^lifestyle]: Becoming free means becoming free of malice and sorrow, and does not necessarily mean changing one's lifestyle (cf. <5cde9fd6>).

[^notes]: I keep a more verbose version of these notes, in the context of personal life events, in my private Zettelkasten. See <455d997b>.
