# Richard's Lifestyle

> [Richard](http://actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/frequentquestions/FAQ12a.htm): I drink **coffee** and **smoke** tobacco because I find them both to be a delightful pastime ... I thoroughly enjoy the entire ritual: the grinding of the beans with its accompanying aroma; the measuring of the grounds into the filter-holder of the espresso machine; the watching of the crema form in the cup as it fills; the adding of just the requisite quantity of thickened cream (yes I also take in cream); the supping of that first exquisite sip with the appropriate sigh of approval; the opening of the tobacco pouch and the inhaling of its aroma; the extracting of a paper and the placing it upon the lip; the sorting out of the strings of tobacco; the rolling of the perfectly shaped cigarette; the tucking-in of the ends and the striking of the match with its accompanying splutter of ignition; the inhaling of that first puff; the taking of the second sip of coffee ... and so on and so on.

> Incidentally, I also eat **meat** (mainly seafood and fowl but occasionally pork, lamb and beef); I do not cook (I either **eat out or order in**); I have an **active sex-life** and enjoy female company; I lead an **indolent life-style** (which is way past a sedentary life-style); I live in **suburbia** with all the mod cons that a consumer society provides; I only have **one meal a day** (plus a few water-crackers with cheese for supper); I **sleep three maybe four hours a night** and cat-nap during the day; I **watch a lot of television** and **spend considerable time in front of the computer**; I do not go to parties, bars, dances and so on or belong to any public organisation or club; I do not play sport or watch any sporting events ... to cut a long story short **I live a certain life-style and do certain things that various other people may find unhealthy for whatever reason**.
