# Casting from command-line

What is the point of owning a Google Cast device like Chromecast or Google Home or Google Home Mini if you cannot control it willy-nilly?

Want to play a sound file, and do it in a script? Use **VLC**:

```dos
&"C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" '.\A Night at the Roxbury Music Video (Haddaway - What is Love).mp3' --sout "#chromecast" --sout-chromecast-ip=192.168.2.159 --demux-filter=demux_chromecast -Idummy
```

You do need to know the IP address of the device, which your router software (at <http://home>) may help reveal. 

## Not perfect

- [ ] Can get stuck; how to 'disconnect' the previous audio?

## Other solutions

- [go-cast](https://github.com/barnybug/go-cast) - can also discover devices, and select them by name. Here's how you ring a bell every hour in PowerShell:
  ```shell
  while(1) {
    .\cast-windows-amd64.exe --name SridMini media play "http://soundbible.com/grab.php?id=2205&type=wav"; 
    sleep (60*60); 
  }
  ```
