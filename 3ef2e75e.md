# Nipping in the bud

The actualism method involves identifying what triggered off the feeling, and see the silliness of that trigger making one no longer feel good. This seeing of silliness enables one to "nip it in the bud" so as to recommence feeling good once again.

Here's how that part of the method is officially described:

> RICHARD: Once the specific moment of ceasing to feel good is pin-pointed, and the silliness  of having such an incident as that (no matter what it is) take away one’s enjoyment and appreciation of this only moment of being alive is seen for what it is – usually some habitual reactive response – one is once more feeling good ... but with a pin-pointed cue to watch out for next time so as to not have that trigger off yet another bout of the same-old same-old. This is called nipping it in the bud before it gets out of hand ... with application and diligence and patience and perseverance one soon gets the knack of this and more and more time is spent enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive. And, of course, once one does get the knack of this, one up-levels ‘feeling good’, as a bottom line each moment again, to ‘feeling happy and harmless’ ... and after that to ‘feeling perfect’. --[This Moment Of Being Alive](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm)
