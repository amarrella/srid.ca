# Use Zettelkasten for personal reflection

I work with my private Zettelkasten notes predominantly for self-reflection purposes (see <7c5337fc?cf>). 

Every day while sipping my morning cup of coffee, I contemplate on the recent life events. I add any new observations or insights into my notes, and then form new connections between them. Sometimes this will have me consolidate multiple notes into one concept; sometimes, a hitherto unacknowledged connection will be formed between two concepts.
