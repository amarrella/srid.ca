# Growth Mindset

People with a "growth mindset" believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study. Growth mindset refers to actively seeking and welcoming feedback (positive or negative), as contrast to having a “fixed mindset”. 

Julia's [How to teach yourself hard things](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/) - mentions growth mindset which, according to the author, *is about replacing the belief “I’m bad at X” with “I haven’t learned about X yet”.*
