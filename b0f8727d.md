# The Familial Cave

It has become fashionable nowadays, in the programming community, to belabor the importance of the social instituitions[^clarify] of love, family, children and the like so as to downplay the hitherto dominant singled-minded passion about computers, etc. in the [hacker culture](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is). The term **familial cave** refers to this brainwashed attitude of the belabourers[^origin].

Some contexts from Twitter (where low-effort posts abound, and thoughtless factoids spread like wildfire):

* On what "actually matters" in life: <https://twitter.com/sjsyrek/status/1276848455705604096>

## Underlying Psychology

* The human "need"[^need] to belong
* The strong desire for love, and to be loved
* The believed inability to break free of these bonds
* The lack of freedom to do the things one would want to do in life, if it not for the instinctual constraints
* The rationalization of one's bondage by downplaying anyone who lives more freely

[^need]: It is of course more accurate to describe this as a "desire" than a "need". The need to belong is unlike say the need for air and water; as you can live without the former (happily in fact).

[^clarify]: Here, we are referring only to the whole (brainwashed) social identity formed around the otherwise carefree and idiosyncratic acts like raising children or sharing roof with fellow human beings.

[^origin]: Derived from [the allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave).
