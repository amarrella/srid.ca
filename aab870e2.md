> To reduce the actualism method to just seeing the silliness of having the prominent feelings which are rare for you (like anger, jealousy, malice) arise – and to then drop them immediately as they begin to do so irrespective of what caused them and at what precise point they started – is to render it indistinguishable from the socialised/acculturated technique of suppressing feelings[^diss] as dutifully practised by billions of peoples world wide ... with the same lack of effect in regards bringing about peace and harmony.
