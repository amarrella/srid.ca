# Naiveté as an aid to deprogram oneself

> RICHARD: No, you are most definitely not ‘too naive’. It is the cultured sophisticates that cause – and have caused – such untold damage on this fair earth. **[[6e564791]] is a beneficence ... it is what I got in touch with to enable me to steer my way through the maze of conditioning ... a conditioning that stretches back into antiquity**. Naiveté is the closest thing one has got to an actual innocence ... one can rely much more upon it to see one’s way clearly than one can rely upon the most profound thought or the most sublime feeling. No matter how lofty the thought or deep the feeling, unless one is nearly innocent, one will never succeed.
