# Be obsessed

Success in actualism requires an obsession that trumps everything else.

> [...] one has to reach out – extend oneself – like one has never done before. One has to **want peace-on-earth as the number one priority in one’s life**. One has to desire freedom from the Human Condition to the point of **obsession and beyond** ... it is that **urgent and essential**. And one does it for a two-fold purpose: for the good of oneself in particular and for one’s fellow humans in general. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/frequentquestions/FAQ43a.htm>

The word "want" denotes desire. One has to want it like one has never wanted anything else:

> RICHARD: The key to being free, then, is not altruism per se but wanting, with
  all of one’s being, to bring to an end, once and for all, the inherent
  suffering which epitomises human nature. Vis.:

> > • \[Richard\]: ‘... one has to want it like one has never wanted anything else
    before ... so much so that all the instinctual passionate energy of desire,
    normally frittered away on petty desires, is fuelling and impelling/
    propelling one into this thing and this thing only (‘impelling’ as in a
    pulling from the front and ‘propelling’ as in being pushed from behind). There
    is a ‘must’ to it (one must do it/ it must happen) and a ‘will’ to it (one
    will do it/ it will happen) and one is both driven and drawn until there is an
    inevitability that sets in. Now it is unstoppable and all the above ceases of
    its own accord ... one is unable to distinguish between ‘me’ doing it and it
    happening to ‘me’. One has escaped one’s fate and achieved one’s destiny’.

  > RICHARD: I do not mean wanting it as in wishful thinking: when I say **one has
  to want it like one has never wanted anything else** before I mean it just like
  that ... like nothing else one has ever wanted before. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-intent2.htm>

Srinath describes it a bit more informally:

> Richard had said that I needed to want it like nothing before. I pondered on
  what I had wanted before and recalled a simple childhood memory of being
  excited about going to the swimming pool when I was about 10 years old. There
  was this completely sincere and thrilling ‘jumping out of my skin’ desire to
  get in the pool. I was beginning to feel a similarly sincere thirst for
  oblivion. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/becomingfreereports/sydneyreport.htm>
