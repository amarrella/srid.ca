#  Intuition curse

**Intuition curse** refers to the act of automatically intuiting a task to be somewhere from overwhelming to underwhelming, or from difficult to easy. It is *prejudging* the qualities of a task, before even beginning to do it. Prejudgment solidifies into a belief that in turn can provoke all sorts of feelings (procrastination, being overwhelmed, avoidance, anxiety, etc.).

The **not knowing** of naivete is its opposite. Intuition curse is derived from "wordly knowledge", which is the accumulated wisdom in one's life. 

To "lift the curse" is to begin to recollect what it was like being naive, prior to having develoed a cynical world view, such that one can face any and all tasks with a fresh perspective.
