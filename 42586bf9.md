# Affective Awareness vs Cognitive Attention

Affective awareness is

- non-cognitive (hence, 'a non-verbal attitude' and 'a wordless approach')
- effortless (it is simple and easy)

> RICHARD: [...] it is an **affective awareness** (i.e., that moment-to-moment affective monitoring of mood [...]) which both maximises felicity/ innocuity and automatically activates conscious attention (as in, engendering **cognitive attentiveness**) whenever something is amiss in regards to enjoyment and appreciation[^ref]
