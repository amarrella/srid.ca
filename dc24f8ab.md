# Undermining the geek identity

Geeks, or more specifically hackers[^def], used to treat their craft as a source of meaning[^ikigai], going contrary to the normative values likes "sex, money, and social approval"[^sex]. In modern times, where "tech" provides financially stable careers to plenty, this dynamic has somewhat reversed among a growing group of people. It has become fashionable to undermine one's geek interests, so as to normalize what's already "normal" (for example, <b0f8727d>) outside tech.

Why the [desire to normalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QereR0CViMY) at all? Does it not go against the much touted, but rarely followed, value of "diversity"?

[^sex]:
    > If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way [a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence] naturally, you'll need to become one in order to make it as a hacker. Otherwise you'll find your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex, money, and social approval. --[How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe1)
