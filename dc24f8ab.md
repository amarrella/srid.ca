# Undermining the geek identity

Geeks, or more specifically hackers (as [ESR refers to](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)) used to treat their craft as a source of meaning, going contrary to the normative values likes "[sex, money, and social approval](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)". In modern times, where "tech" provides financially stable careers to plenty, this dynamic has somewhat reversed among a growing group of people. It has become fashionable to undermine one's geek interests, so as to normalize what's already "normal" outside tech.
