# Switching to Windows as a Unix developer

{.ui .message}
This note is a work in progress.

## Basics

* Install [**WSL 2**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10): Enables us to run Ubuntu, etc in a seamless manner.
* Istall [**Windows Terminal Preview**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab): This will be our terminal app. Yes, Windows has an almost as good a terminal as Unix these days.

## Powershell for Unix users

* Start an administrator shell (equivalent to **sudo**):
```shell
Start-Process -Verb RunAs powershell
```
* [Manage services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/samples/managing-services?view=powershell-7)
  * Enable **ssh-agent**:
  ```
  Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
  Start-Service ssh-agent
  ```


## Todo

- [ ] ssh-agent and ssh keys (in PowerShell?)
