# Switching to Windows as a Unix developer

I made the decision to use Windows on my laptop, which was mostly occasioned by my <4fdbc878?cf> (NixOS) lately. The idea is to experience the best of both worlds --- a performant, flexible and open development environment to which I remote from a laptop with great user experience as well as battery life.

## Basics

* Install [**WSL 2**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10): Enables us to run Ubuntu, etc in a seamless manner.
* Install [**Windows Terminal Preview**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab): This will be our terminal app. Yes, Windows has an almost as good a terminal as Unix these days.

## For power users

* Install [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys)

## Nix

Follow instructions at <https://github.com/srid/nix-config> to get most software installed through Nix and home-manager.


## Things to learn

- [X] WSL
- [ ] PowerShell
- [ ] ...

## Powershell for Unix users

* Start an administrator shell (equivalent to **sudo**):
```shell
Start-Process -Verb RunAs powershell
```
* [Manage services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/samples/managing-services?view=powershell-7)
  * Enable **ssh-agent**:
  ```
  Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
  Start-Service ssh-agent
  ```
  
### Known issues

- Use Ubuntu's ssh, until <https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1263> gets resolved.
