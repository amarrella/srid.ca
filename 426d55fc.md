# Enjoyment

To practice the actualism method is the same as enjoying and appreciating life[^def].

[^def]:
    > The wide and wondrous path to an actual freedom from the human condition is marked by **enjoyment** and appreciation – the sheer delight of being as happy and harmless as is humanly possible whilst remaining a ‘self’ – and the slightest diminishment of such felicity/ innocuity is a warning signal (a flashing red light as it were) that one has inadvertently wandered off the way. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm>

Enjoyment is effortless ([[7857b534]]).

Enjoyment entails felicitous and innocuous feelings (delight; enjoyment; tranquillity; affability), in contrast to 'good' feelings (affection; endearment; sympathy; commiseration) and 'bad' feelings (hatred; resentment; sadness; grief).[^diff]

[^diff]:
    > RICHARD: As a broad generalisation: the ‘good’ feelings are those that are of a loving (ardent feelings of profound affection and endearment) and a compassionate (empathetic feelings of deep sympathy and commiseration) nature; the ‘bad feelings are those that are of a malicious (spiteful feelings of intense hatred and resentment) and a sorrowful (melancholy feelings of yawning sadness and grief) nature; the felicitous feelings are those that are of a happy and carefree (blithesome feelings of great delight and enjoyment) nature; the innocuous feelings are those that are of a harmless and congenial (gracious feelings of ingenuous tranquillity and affability) nature. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/frequentquestions/FAQ63a.htm>
