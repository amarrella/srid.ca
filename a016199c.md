# Developing on ChromeOS

:::{.ui .message}
Work in progress
:::

As an alternative to <9623c240?cf> ... what does it take to program on a Chromebook, like the Pixel Slate?

## Software
- [x] Install Nix and use home-manager to declaratively manage system config
- [ ] Avoid slow compilation
  - [x] Setup NixOS cache on a remote server
  - [ ] HTTP basic auth: <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/1215>
- [ ] Local development vs developping remotely?

## Hardware
- Keyboard: Brydge keyboard
- [ ] Coffee shop setup
  - A bluetooth keyboard with Apple Magic Trackpad
  - A stand that lifts the Slate to eye-level
  - USB dongle to connect the Trackpad
  - A suitable bag to carry all these
