# Announcing Cerveau [Draft]

Today I'd like to announce the public beta [Cerveau](https://www.cerveau.app), the web app for managing plain-text notes directly on a GitHub repository. 

## Motivation

I developed [[b6df4059]] primarily because I wanted a future-proof solution to note-taking, and as such my notes are in plain-text, and stored in a Git repo. However I still wanted a **web-based workflow** to edit my notes while still adhering to neuron's [future-proof philosophy](https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html). And so Cerveau was born.

## How does it work?

All notes are written in Markdown, and stored in a Git repository. Cerveau directly modifies the contents of the repository using [GitHub Apps API](https://developer.github.com/apps/), while caching the latest revision of the repository on a PostgreSQL database. 

## Tech stack

Both the backend and frontend components of Cerveau are written in [[2009703]]. The frontend uses [[2012405]] ...

Outline:

- Motivation: "on the go" editing, whilst still using Git and plain-text
- Why ghcjs? Because, neuron can be compiled to browser code (JS now, WASM later)
- Why reflex? Because Elm was sweet, and Haskell is god.
- Obelisk: reflex for full-stack app development
- rhyolite:
  - real-time notificatoins using postgre notify
- GitHub Apps 
  - fine-grained repo access & future possibilities
  - Git as data API
- Nix
  - obelisk uses nix
  - nixos for deployment
  - niv for tracking
