# Announcing Cerveau -- full-stack Haskell web app

{.ui .red .inverted .centered .message}
Work in progress draft. DO NOT LINK PUBLICLY.

Today I'd like to announce the public beta of [Cerveau](https://www.cerveau.app), the web app for managing plain-text notes ([Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)-style) directly on a GitHub repository.

:::{.ui .message}
**tl;dr** - Write plain-text notes; keep them in Git; all the while being able to navigate and edit them from the web-browser. And it is all written in Haskell!
:::

## Motivation

I developed [[b6df4059]] primarily because I wanted a future-proof solution to note-taking. As such all notes I write are in plain-text format, and stored in a Git repo. However I still wanted a **web-based workflow** to edit my notes while still adhering to neuron's [future-proof philosophy](https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html). And so Cerveau was born.

## How does it work?

All notes are written in Markdown, and stored in a Git repository. Cerveau directly modifies the contents of the repository using [GitHub Apps API](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps), while caching the latest revision of the repository on a PostgreSQL database. This allows me to edit my notes from a web browser (as well as from a mobile phone), while keeping the canonical version always on Git.

## Tech stack

Both the backend and frontend components of Cerveau are written in [[2009703]]. The frontend uses [[2012405]], via the excellent [[2012403]] framework. WebSockets, via [[2012401]], is used for real-time communication between the backend and the frontend; if you have two windows open, then updating a note from one window will have the other window automatically update its view without an explicit refresh (this works even if you are viewing a different that has the modified note in its backlinks). Editor widget is based on CodeMirror, via [reflex-codemirror](https://github.com/Atidot/reflex-codemirror).

Cerveau uses [[b6df4059]]'s Haskell source code as a library, which gets compiled to JavaScript by GHCJS, thereby enabling neuron's core features to work on the browser; for example, live HTML preview while editing the note.

[[2017102]] is used for both developent and deployment; the production version in particular is deployed to a [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/d19bbb4d33e8) droplet running [[c7170724]].

**TODO**: Explain the motivation behind choosing a) FRP, b) GHCJS (instead of Elm or PureScript), b) Nix.

## Open-source sustainability

I created the open-source [[b6df4059]] to [scratch my own itch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_one%27s_own_itch). Cerveau was born out of the same motivation, however I'm offering a hosted version of it to others as a "luxury on top" to encourage interested folks to sponsor the [[b6df4059]] project. I'd like to find out if the GitHub sponsor system will enable me to spend majority of my time working on open-source.

[www.cerveau.app](https://www.cerveau.app) offers a Free account (limited notes) for anybody to try, as well as a Pro account (unlimited notes) for [certain GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/srid).

**Will Cerveau be open-sourced?** Although nothing concrete has come up yet, I'm entertaining the idea of open-sourcing Cerveau after getting [N number of sponsors](https://twitter.com/availablegreen/status/1291162883125137408). But, all of this very much depends on the ongoing success of the Cerveau's sponsorship model.

## What's next?

User-level roadmap for Cerveau is [tracked here](https://github.com/srid/cerveau-issues/issues). Two major features I'd like to see done myself next are:

* **Auto-completion of links**: typing `[[` in the CodeMirror text editor should bring up an autocomplete popup of note titles.
* **Auto-save**: auto-save notes while editing, to provide a Google Docs like feel.
