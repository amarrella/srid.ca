# Cerveau: a future-proof web app for notes, in Haskell

{.ui .red .inverted .centered .message}
Work in progress draft. DO NOT LINK PUBLICLY.

Today I'd like to announce the public beta of [Cerveau][cerveau], the web app for managing plain-text notes directly on a GitHub repository. Cerveau integrates directly with [[b6df4059]] (also written in Haskell) which supports [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)-style note-taking in Markdown.

## Motivation

I developed [[b6df4059]] primarily because I wanted a future-proof solution to note-taking. As such all notes I write are in plain-text format, and stored in a Git repo. However I still wanted a **web-based workflow** to edit my notes while still adhering to neuron's [future-proof philosophy](https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html). And so Cerveau was born.

## How does it work?

All notes are written in Markdown, and stored in a Git repository. Cerveau directly modifies the contents of the repository using [GitHub Apps API](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps), while caching the latest revision of the repository on a PostgreSQL database. This allows me to edit my notes from a web browser (as well as from a mobile phone), while keeping the canonical version always on Git all the while allowing edits from elsewhere, such as [Emacs](https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode#neuron-mode).

## Tech stack

Both the backend and frontend components of Cerveau are written in [[2009703]]. Haskell is my programming language of choice, because it gets a lot of things right (see [Why Haskell matters](https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_matters)). Software I write in Haskell tends to be reliable; and I can refactor with confidence without being afraid of introducing bugs. This is especially important when producing otherwise brittle JavaScript.

The frontend too is written in Haskell, with GHCJS compiler compiling it to low-level JavaScript code for running in the browser. Cerveau uses the [[2012405]] library, via the excellent [[2012403]] framework. Obelisk is the perfect choice for writing full-stack apps in Haskell, because it does a lot of leg for you as a developer so you can focus on the FRP application logic. FRP, and similar models of UI programming, is simpler to write and extend. Anybody who writes Elm can attest to that; however unlike Elm or PureScript, GHCJS code can be *shared* with the backend. This is what enables Cerveau directly reuse much of the [[b6df4059]] source code, thus enabling neuron's core features to work directly on the browser--for example, live HTML preview while editing the note.

WebSockets, via [[2012401]], is used for real-time communication between the backend and the frontend; if you have two windows open, then updating a note from one window will have the other window automatically update its view without an explicit refresh (this works even if you are viewing a different that has the modified note in its backlinks). Editor widget is based on CodeMirror, via [reflex-codemirror](https://github.com/Atidot/reflex-codemirror).

[[2017102]] is used for both developent and deployment; the production version in particular is deployed to a [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/d19bbb4d33e8) droplet running [[c7170724]]. Nix makes reproducible development environment easy and possible. A testament to this is how easy it is to contribute to neuron (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/srid/neuron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) - as with one command, `nix-shell`, you get the full develpoment enviornment including Haskell IDE support from a pristine system.

## Towards perfecting future-proof note-taking

I created the open-source [[b6df4059]] to [scratch my own itch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_one%27s_own_itch), wherein I wanted to maintain my notes for a lifetime, without being dependent on any proprietory formats or systems. I still wasn't totally satisfied however, because I did not want to give up on the convenience of managing notes from a web app on my mobile phone. I didn't want to be tied to a desktop text editor. So, Cerveau was born - which resolved that dissatifaction without compromising on future-proofness.

Making future-proof note-taking awesome is my current goal. [LSP support](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/213) for Neuron is just one of the things we can do, to achieve that goal.

Where Cerveau fit in all of this? I'm position Cerveau as a "luxury on top", and as a gift to those help [sponsor the open-source Neuron][sponsor]. 

Cerveau was born out of the same motivation, however I'm offering a hosted version of it to others as a "luxury on top" to encourage interested folks to sponsor the [[b6df4059]] project. 

[www.cerveau.app][cerveau] offers a Free account (limited notes) for anybody to try, as well as a Pro account (unlimited notes) for [GitHub sponsors][sponsor] on the "Cerveau Pro Plan" tier or above.

**Will Cerveau be open-sourced?** Although nothing concrete has come up yet, I'm entertaining the idea of eventually open-sourcing Cerveau after getting [N number of sponsors](https://twitter.com/availablegreen/status/1291162883125137408). But, all of this is very much dependend on the ongoing success of the Cerveau's sponsorship model.

## What's next?

User-level roadmap for Cerveau is [tracked here](https://github.com/srid/cerveau-issues/issues). Two major features I'd like to see done myself next are:

* **Auto-completion of links**: typing `[[` in the CodeMirror text editor should bring up an autocomplete popup of note titles.
* **Auto-save**: auto-save notes while editing, to provide a Google Docs like feel.
